This code was built as a part of the **Assignment 2 - Data, Privacy and Fairness** for the course ECSE 557 - Introduction to Ethics of Intelligent Systems. Google Colaboratory was used for the entire project. The code `Assignment_2_Part1.ipynb` and `Assignment_2_Part2.ipynb` requires numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, difflib and many more libraries to run. The code for importing these libraries has already been included in the .ipynb file.  

● Instructions to run the code on Google Colaboratory. 

1. The code first needs to be uploaded to google colaboratory. Instead of uploading, the code can also be copy pasted to a new notebook on google colaboratory and can be executed.
2. The data (`heart_assignment2.csv`) must be uploaded in the Google Drive beforehand, to run the code. After this one can run this in google colaboratory easily.  

● Instructions to run the code locally on the computer. 

The data should be present in the same folder in which `Assignment_2_Part1.ipynb` and `Assignment_2_Part2.ipynb` are present. Once that is ensured, start running a jupyter notebook on the local computer and make sure all the necessary libraries are imported beforehand.
