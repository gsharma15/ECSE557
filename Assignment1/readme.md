This code was build as a part of the Assignment 1 - Fundamentals, principles, and values for the course of ECSE557 Introduction to Ethics of Intelligent Systems. 

Google Colaboratory was used for the entire project. The code GauriSharma_Assignment1_Part2.ipynb requires numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, plotly to run. The code for importing these libraries has already been included in the .ipynb file.

	▪	Instructions to run the code on Google Colaboratory

The code first needs to be uploaded to google colaboratory. Instead of uploading, the code can also be copy pasted to a new notebook on google colaboratory and then can be executed. 
The data (heart_modified.csv) must be uploaded in the Google Drive beforehand, to run the code.  After this one can run this in google colaboratory easily.

	▪	Instructions to run the code locally on the computer 

The data should be present in the same folder in which GauriSharma_Assignment1_Part2.ipynb is present. Once that is ensured, start running jupyter notebook in the local computer and make sure all the necessary libraries as mentioned before are present in the local computer.
